    <h1>Manual for the Amberbio app</h1>

    <p>
      The Amberbio app allows scientists to analyze and visualize data sets, in particular
      biological data, on mobile devices. All calculations are performed directly on the device and
      all data is stored locally. The functionality should be evident from the user interface and it
      is not necessary to read the manual to use the app. The manual gives a high level overview of
      the app and explains some important details that are not clear from the user interface such as
      some mathematical details.
    </p>
    <p>
      This manual is available in the app and on the web
      at <a href="http://www.amberbio.com/manual">www.amberbio.com/manual</a>.

    <p>
      The app has a home page that is reached by tapping the home icon in the upper left
      corner. Navigation is done from the home page by tapping the icons or by the back and forward
      buttons.

  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="projects-and-data-sets">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Projects and data sets</a></h1>
    <p>
      The app handles projects and data sets. A data set is a set of values organized in a table
      with rows and columns. A project is a collection of one or more data sets.  A project is
      always created with a data set called "The original data set".  Other data sets within a
      project are created by the app using various methods such as normalization or sample removal.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The columns of a data set are called samples and the rows are called molecules. The values in
      the table represent an intensity, or some other quantity, for a sample-molecule pair. Data
      sets could represent biological information such as gene expression, protein abundances,
      microRNA expressions, peptide abundances, or metabolite concentrations. Data sets do not need
      to be of biological nature even though the app uses terminology from biology.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      A project also contains factor, or grouping, information about the samples. A factor has one
      or more levels. An example of a factor is "Gender" with levels "male" and "female". Naturally,
      factors are shared for all data sets within a project.
    </p>

    <p>
      A project can also contain extra information about the molecules. This information is called
      molecule annotations. An example could be the molecule annotation "Chromosome" where each
      molecule has a value such as "chromosome 21".
    </p>
  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="the-active-data-set">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">The active data set</a></h1>
    <p>
      Analysis is performed on the active data set. Selection of the active data set is done on the
      page <span class="app-page">Data Set Selection</span>.  The active project is the project to
      which the active data set belongs. Editing and adding factors and molecule annotations are
      done in the active project.
    </p>

    <p>
     There is almost always an active data set and project. The only exceptions are when the app
     starts the first time and when the active project is deleted. When a new data set is created,
     the app automatically makes the new data set active and jumps to the
     page <span class="app-page">Data Set Selection</span>
    </p>
  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="import-of-data">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Import of data</a></h1>
    <p>
      Data import is used to create new projects and to add factor and molecule annotation
      information to projects. Import of data is a two step process. First, a file is imported into
      the app. Second, the file is read and parsed and the data is imported into a database kept by
      the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      Import of data is handled by the page <span class="app-page">Import data</span>. All imported
files can be seen on this page.  The app keeps all imported files until they are deleted by the
user.
    </p>
  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="import-of-files">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Import of files</a></h1>
    <p>
      The app can import files with extension "txt" or "sqlite". The "txt" files represent tables of
      data supplied by the user. The "sqlite" is a database file that has been exported from the app
      at an earlier time. The "sqlite" files are used for backup and transfer of projects from one
      device to another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Files can be imported in two ways; either by "opening" the file in another app or by import from a cloud storage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Importing a file by "opening" it in another app is done by tapping the file in the other app
      and selecting the Amberbio app. A typical use case is to open an email attachment by tapping
      the attachment in the Mail app.
    </p>

    <p>
      Files can be imported from a cloud storage such as iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Box, or Google
      Drive. The import is done by tapping "Import new file" on the
      page <span class="app-page">Import data</span>. The corresponding cloud storage app must
      itself be installed on the device.
    </p>
  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="parsing-import-files">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Parsing import files</a></h1>
    <p>
      Imported files are shown on the page <span class="app-page">Import data</span>. By tapping a
      file, the file can be parsed and read into the database of the app. Files with extension
      "sqlite" are read automatically into projects. Files with extension "txt" file can be used to
      create a new project, to import factors to the active project, or to import molecule
      annotations to the active project.
    </p>
  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="file-format-of-txt-files">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">File format of txt files</a></h1>
    <p>
      The "txt" files contain tables of values. The rows, or lines, are separated by "\n", "\r", or
      "\r\n", and the cells are separated by "\t" or ",". The file extension should be "txt" in any
      case. The app tries to find the separator by first searching for tabs. If there are tabs, the
      app tries to read the file as a tab separated file. If there are no tabs, the file is read as
      a comma separated file. Tabs are never allowed within the cells. If there are commas within the
      cells, the file must be tab separated. The three types of "txt" files are described below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first file type contains the measurement values. This file is used to create a new
      project. It contains samples in the columns and molecules in the rows. The first row contains
      the sample names. The first column contains the molecule names. The values are written in the
      cells.
    </p>

    <p>
      The decimal separator can be either point as in "12.98" or comma as in "12,98". If the decimal
      separator is comma, the file must be tab separated. Missing values must be written as (the
      empty string), NA, na, NaN, NAN, or nan. The upper left cell can contain anything. An example
      value table with two missing values is shown below.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Anything</td>
        <td>Sample 1</td>
        <td>Sample 2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Molecule 1</td>
        <td>6.7</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Molecule 2</td>
        <td>-0.45</td>
        <td>NaN</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Molecule 3</td>
        <td>50</td>
        <td>-12</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The second file type contains factors for the samples. Factors can be imported into a project
      at any time and are not part of the initial creation of the project. The first row of the
      factor file contains sample names. The first column contains factor names. The values are the
      levels for the factor and sample. The upper left cell can be anything. The factor names must
      be distinct and the sample names can come in any order. All samples of the project must be
      present. Extra samples will be ignored. An example factor table is shown below
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Anything</td>
        <td>Sample 1</td>
        <td>Sample 2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gender</td>
        <td>Male</td>
        <td>Female</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Disease</td>
        <td>Cancer</td>
        <td>Alzheimer</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Age</td>
        <td>55</td>
        <td>78</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The third file type contains molecule annotations and it can be imported at any time and is
      not part of the initial creation of the project. The first row contains the name of the molecule
      annotation. The first column must contain all the molecule names. The order of the rows is
      arbitrary and extra molecules are ignored. An example molecule annotation table is shown below
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Anything</td>
        <td>Unigene</td>
        <td>Chromosome</td>
      </tr>

  <section-manual id="result-files">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Result files</a></h1>
    <p>
      Result files are created by the app. The result files are figures and tables and have the file
      extension "txt", "pdf", or "png".  The result files are kept on the page
      <span class="app-page">Result files</span>. The result files can be sent by email, opened in

    <p>
      On the page <span class="app-page">User</span>, a name and a list of emails can be
      typed. There are no user accounts in the app. The name is only used for comments in the result
      files and the project notes. The emails are used as suggested emails when a file is sent by
      email from the app. The actual destination emails can always be changed before sending the
      email.

  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="anova">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Anova</a></h1>
    <p>
      The Anova test is performed on the selected levels of a factor. The selected levels are
      highlighted, and the anova test is performed by tapping the blue factor name. For each
      molecule a standard Anova test is performed by removing samples with missing values,
      calculating the F-statistic as the ratio of between-groups variation divided by the
      within-groups variation. The p-value is the upper tail of the cumulative F-distribution.
    </p>
  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="pairwise-test">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Pairwise test</a></h1>
    <p>
      After selecting a factor, any number of pairwise tests between two levels can be selected in
      the table. The pairwise test will be performed on all pairs and presented in a table. The
      t-test is a standard student t-test with equal variance. The p-value from the Wilcoxon test,
      which is the same as the Mann-Whitney test, is calculated as an exact value for small sample
      size and by the Normal distribution approximation for large sample sizes.  The p-values are
      two-sided.
    </p>
  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="paired-test">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Paired test</a></h1>
    <p>
      A pairing factor must be selected. Samples with the same level for the pairing factor can be
      paired.  An example of a pairing factor is "Patient" and the levels are the patient ids or
      names. For each patient, two or more samples are measured.
    </p>

    <p>
      The comparison factor is the factor for which the levels will be compared. When two levels of
      the comparison factor are compared, the pairs of samples are defined as follows. For each
      pairing factor level, there must be exactly one sample for each of the two comparison levels
      with that particular pairing factor level. An example of a comparison factor is "Time" with
      the levels "morning" and "evening". In this case, a pairwise test will be performed between
      the evening and morning samples for each patient.
    </p>

    <p>
      The t-test is performed by subtracting the values of the paired samples in the two selected
      comparison levels. The p-value is two-sided and tests the null hypothesis that the difference
      between the comparison levels is zero.
    </p>
  </section-manual>

  <section-manual id="linear-regression">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Linear regression</a></h1>
    <p>
      For the selected factor, the levels with a numeric interpretation are chosen. A level can be
      converted to a number if it starts with, or is, a numeric values, such as "5 days" or
      "12.3". For each molecule, the samples with a numeric level and a non-missing value are used
      for the linear regression. The intercept and slope are calculated by least square
      regression.
    </p>

    <p>
      The p-value is an Anova p-value and tests the null-hypothesis that the slope is zero, i.e. low
      p-values imply that there is a trend with a non-zero slope. The Anova test is performed by
      calculating a F-statistic as the ratio where the numerator is the variation between the line
      and a simple mean value, and the denominator is the residual variation from the fitted line. A
      large F-statistic, and correspondingly low p-value, implies that the line is a much better fit
      than a single mean value.

  <section-manual id="multiple-hypothesis-testing">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Multiple hypothesis testing</a></h1>
    <p>
      Multiple hypothesis testing is performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate
      method. The columns named false discovery rate contains the q-values of the molecules.
    </p>

    <p>
      A histogram of the p-values can be seen by tapping "histogram". High frequencies for the low
      p-values imply a significant difference between the groups.

   <section-manual id="supervised-classification">
     <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">Supervised classification</a></h1>
     <p>
     The supervised classifiers separate samples into two or more levels. A classifier is
     trained on a training set and afterwards tested on a test set.
     </p>

     <p>
       There are three modes in which the classifiers in the app can be used; a fixed training set,
       leave-one-out cross validation, and k-fold cross validation.
     </p>

     <p>
       When a fixed training set is chosen, the classifier is tested on all remaining samples, both
       those with actual levels matching the levels of the classifier and those with actual levels
       different from the levels known to the classifier. The latter type of samples can not be used
       to estimate the predictive power of the classifier. However, often it is still useful to know
       the predicted levels of these samples. For instance, if the classifier has the levels "sick"
       and "healthy", it might be useful to classify "borderline" samples into either "healthy" or
       "sick".
    </p>

     <p>
       For leave-one-out cross validation, each sample is left out and tested with the remaining
       samples as the training set. In that way, each sample obtains one classified level which can
       be compared to the real level. Leave-one-out classification only uses the samples with levels
       known to the classifier.
     </p>

     <p>
       For k-fold cross validation, the samples are divided randomly into k subsets of almost
       equal size; if the number of samples is not divisible by k, some subsets will be one sample
       larger than other subsets.  Each subset is tested on a classifier trained by the remaining
       samples. In that way, each sample obtains one classified level which can be compared to the
       real level. Cross validation only uses the samples with levels that are known to the
       classifier.
     </p>

     <p>
       In the special case where k is equal to the number of samples, k-fold cross validation is
       equal to leave-one-out cross validation. Leave-one-out cross validation has its own selection
       in the app because of it importance.
     </p>
   </section-manual>
    
  <section-manual id="knn">
    <h1><a href="#table-of-contents">k nearest neighbor classification</a></h1>
    <p>
      Given a training set and a test sample, the k training samples with the smallest distances to
      the test sample are found. The levels of these k nearest samples are considered, and if there
      is a single level that constitutes a majority of the k samples, that level is chosen as the
      predicted level for the test sample. If no level obtains a majority alone, the test sample is
      considered unclassified. If the classifier has only two levels and k is odd, there is always
      one level with a majority. In other cases, samples might be unclassified.
    </p>

    <p>
      The distance measure is euclidean distance. Only molecules without missing values in the
      combined training set and test set are included in the distance calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case of ambiguity in the k nearest neighbors due to ties in the distances, the classifier
      makes an arbitrary, but non-random, choice. This situation practically never occurs in real
      biological data.

      The support vector machine (SVM) classification uses the software library LIBSVM: "Chih-Chung
      Chang and Chih-Jen Lin, LIBSVM : a library for support vector machines. ACM Transactions on
      Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2:27:1--27:27, 2011". The LIBSVM software is available at
      http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm. The Amberbio app uses the LIBSVM library to train
      an SVM classifier and calculate the decision values and predicted classes for test samples.

      The SVM classifier in the app can compare two or more levels. A standard SVM classifier can
      directly classify two levels. Comparisons between K levels are performed by the LIBSVM library
      by performing all K(K - 1)/2 pairwise comparisons and selecting the level that wins most
      pairwise comparisons.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is recommended to use logarithmic values for the SVM classifier. No scaling or other
      pre-processing is performed by the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the binary classifier (two levels), a decision value is calculated. Samples with positive
      decision values are classified in one level and those with negative decision values in the
      other level. Using a variable threshold instead of a fixed zero threshold, a whole curve of
      classifiers is obtained. Plotting the true positive rate versus the false positive rate for
      variable thresholds leads to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under
      the curve is a measure of the success of the classifier. Good classifiers have areas close to
      1, whereas bad classifiers have areas close to 0.5.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ROC curve only applies to the binary classifier. Call the two levels A and B. The true
      positive rate is defined as the fraction of samples with an actual level of A that are
      predicted to have level A.  The false positive rate is defined as the fraction of samples of
      level B that are classified as level A. The true positive rate is also called the
      sensitivity. The false positive rate is equal to 1 - specificity.
    </p>

      The kernels are the linear kernel and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of Gaussian
      functions. The parameter C is the coefficient of the error term in the optimizing
      function. The parameter gamma is the scale parameter in the exponent of the Gaussian function.
      A proper explanation can be found in any article or book about support vector machines. The
      app uses the same terminology as LIBSVM.
    </p>

    <p>
      The linear kernel with default parameter is usually a good choice for biological data with
      many molecules and relatively few samples.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only molecules without missing values in the training and test sets are used for the SVM.
